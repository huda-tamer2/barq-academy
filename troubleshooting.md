# Troubleshooting Journal

This journal records the actual investigation and repair work performed during the
BARQ DevOps assessment. Failed attempts are included only where they occurred
during the investigation.

## 1. Application readiness failure: missing PostgreSQL configuration

### Symptom
The application containers were running, but application readiness did not pass.
The application could not establish the expected PostgreSQL connection.

### Hypothesis
The PostgreSQL container itself might be unhealthy, PostgreSQL might not be
reachable over the Docker backend network, or the application might have incorrect
database configuration.

### Commands and tests

Checked the service state:

```bash
sudo docker compose ps

The PostgreSQL service was healthy and Redis was also available. The application
configuration was missing the required DATABASE_URL.

### Root cause

The application did not have the PostgreSQL connection string configured.

### Fix

Added the PostgreSQL connection string to the application environment:

DATABASE_URL=postgresql://barq_app:${POSTGRES_PASSWORD}@postgres:5432/barq_tasks

Redis was also configured explicitly:

REDIS_URL=redis://redis:6379/0

### Retest

Application readiness was checked again after recreating the application
containers. The application became ready and could communicate with PostgreSQL
and Redis.

## 2. NGINX upstream failure and backend failover

### Symptom

When app-01 was stopped, requests through NGINX did not consistently fail over
to app-02.

### Initial test

Stopped app-01:

sudo docker stop app-01

Sent ten requests through NGINX:

for i in {1..10}; do
    curl -s -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code}\n' http://127.0.0.1:8080/instance
done

The test produced both successful and failed responses, including 502 and 504.

### Failed attempt

Tried to reload NGINX while app-01 was stopped.

NGINX reported:

host not found in upstream "app-01:8080"

Further investigation showed that the app-01 Docker network endpoint was
temporarily inconsistent even though the container existed and appeared healthy.

### Root cause

There were two contributing problems:

1. The original NGINX configuration did not provide suitable upstream failure
   handling.
2. The Docker network endpoint for app-01 was inconsistent.

### Fix

Recreated only app-01:

sudo docker compose up -d --force-recreate app-01

The NGINX upstream configuration was updated to:

server app-01:8080 max_fails=2 fail_timeout=5s;
server app-02:8080 max_fails=2 fail_timeout=5s;

NGINX was also configured to retry suitable upstream failures:

proxy_next_upstream error timeout http_502 http_503 http_504;

### Verification

Checked the NGINX configuration:

sudo docker exec nginx nginx -t

Reloaded NGINX:

sudo docker exec nginx nginx -s reload

Stopped app-01 again and sent ten requests. All ten returned HTTP 200 through
app-02.

Restored app-01:

sudo docker start app-01

Both application instances returned to a healthy state and traffic was again
distributed between them.

## 3. Redis persistence failure

### Symptom

Redis used AOF persistence, but the counter value did not survive Redis container
recreation.

### Investigation

Checked Redis AOF configuration and its data directory:

sudo docker exec redis redis-cli CONFIG GET appendonly
sudo docker exec redis sh -c 'ls -la /data'

AOF was enabled, but /data was not backed by a persistent Docker volume.

### Root cause

AOF persistence inside the container does not preserve data when the container
filesystem is discarded.

### Fix

Added a named volume:

redis-data:/data

and declared the named volume in Compose.

### Verification

Redis was recreated while keeping the named volume. The counter value continued
from the previously persisted value after recreation.

### Commit

04b95ad - Persist Redis AOF in named volume

---

## 4. PostgreSQL backup and restore

### Symptom

The assessment required a PostgreSQL backup and a real restore demonstration.

### Backup

Created a backup with:

./backup.sh

The generated SQL backup was stored under backups/. The directory is excluded
from Git.

### Failed restore attempt

The backup was first restored directly into the existing barq_tasks database.

This produced expected conflicts because the schema and records already existed.
Errors included an existing relation, an existing sequence, duplicate primary
keys, and an existing primary key constraint.

### Clean restore

The application containers were stopped. The barq_tasks database was dropped
and recreated using the PostgreSQL owner. The backup was then restored into the
clean database.

The restored database contained the records that existed at backup time.
A record created after the backup was absent, proving that the restore returned
the database to the backup state.

### Verification

The application was restarted and /records was checked. The restored data was
available through the application.

## 5. PostgreSQL persistence across container recreation

### Test record

Created the following test record:

CONTAINER_RECREATE_TEST

### Test

The PostgreSQL container was stopped and removed without deleting its named
volume:

sudo docker stop postgres
sudo docker rm postgres

The named PostgreSQL volume remained present.

The PostgreSQL service was recreated:

sudo docker compose up -d postgres

### Verification

Checked PostgreSQL health:

sudo docker inspect postgres --format '{{.State.Health.Status}}'

Result:

healthy

Checked the test record through the public application endpoint:

curl -s http://127.0.0.1:8080/records | grep -o 'CONTAINER_RECREATE_TEST'

Result:

CONTAINER_RECREATE_TEST

### Conclusion

The record survived PostgreSQL container recreation because the database data is
stored in the named postgres-data volume rather than the disposable container
filesystem.

## 6. Validation script false failures

### Symptom

The first implementation of validate.py reported failures even though parts of
the environment were functioning correctly.

### Investigation

The validator incorrectly treated an internal Docker port declaration such as
8080/tcp as a published host port.

It also expected a NGINX healthcheck that was not present in the Compose
configuration.

An application network endpoint was also temporarily inconsistent during the
earlier NGINX investigation.

### Fix

The validator was corrected to:

- distinguish container ports from published host ports;
- verify the actual NGINX public binding;
- validate Docker network membership;
- validate backend network isolation;
- check service health and application readiness;
- verify both application instances receive traffic.

### Verification

The final validation run reported:

=== VALIDATION PASSED ===
All required checks passed.

## 7. Backend failure and recovery test

### Test

The failure test measured traffic before, during, and after stopping one backend.

Baseline:

20/20 successful requests
app-01: 9
app-02: 11
errors: 0

During app-01 failure:

20/20 successful requests
app-02: 20
errors: 0

After recovery:

20/20 successful requests
app-01: 10
app-02: 10
errors: 0

### Conclusion

NGINX successfully continued serving traffic through app-02 while app-01 was
unavailable. After recovery, traffic returned to both application instances.

### Commit

d906c2b - Implement backend failure recovery test

## 8. Current PostgreSQL persistence retest

The PostgreSQL container was recreated while preserving the named volume.

The service was brought back with:

sudo docker compose up -d postgres

Health was verified:

sudo docker inspect postgres --format '{{.State.Health.Status}}'

Result:

healthy

The persistence record was then checked:

curl -s http://127.0.0.1:8080/records | grep -o 'CONTAINER_RECREATE_TEST'

Result:

CONTAINER_RECREATE_TEST

This confirms the persistence test remains valid after the latest PostgreSQL
container recreation.

---

## Conclusion

The major runtime issues investigated during the assessment were:

- missing application PostgreSQL configuration;
- NGINX upstream failover behavior;
- an inconsistent Docker network endpoint;
- Redis persistence without a volume;
- PostgreSQL restore into a non-empty database;
- PostgreSQL container recreation and persistence;
- false failures in the first validation implementation.

Each issue was investigated with commands and observable results before the
corresponding fix was applied. Successful fixes were retested and committed.
